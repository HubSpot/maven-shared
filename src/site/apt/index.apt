Maven Filtering

  These Plexus components have been built from the filtering process/code in Maven Resources Plugin.

  The goal is to provide a shared component for all plugins which needs to filter resources.
  
* What's New in 1.0-beta-2 (All of this new features are configurable with the MavenResourcesExecution bean)

** Release Note

  The release note is available {{{http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?version=14488&styleName=Html&projectId=11761&Create=Create}here}}.

** Pom interpolation
  
  {{{http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MSHARED-60}[MSHARED-60]}} something like $\{foo.url\} was interpolated to the value of pom url.
  Now pom values will interpolated <<<only>>> with expressions starting with pom or project (it's configurable).\
  This means before something like $\{foo.version\} or $\{version\} was interpolated with the current pom version. 
  <<Now it won't be interpolated with a pom value.>>
  
** Escaping Interpolation 

  {{{http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MSHARED-51}[MSHARED-51]}} It's possible now to define a String which will escape interpolation.\
  \$\{java.home\} will be interpolated to $\{java.home\}

** targetPath accepts now absolute paths too

** overwrite parameter

  {{{http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MSHARED-67}[MSHARED-67]}} Add a new parameter to force file copy even if the destination file is newer.

* MavenResourcesFiltering

  This component will apply filtering on a <<<List>>> of <<<org.apache.maven.model.Resource>>>.

  If you want to use the default <<<List>>> of <<<FileUtils.FilterWrapper>>> (see below)
  you should use the method without the <<<filterWrappers>>> parameter.

  The component will not filter a predefined set of file extensions (jpg, jpeg, gif, bmp, png).
  Note: you can easily add extra file extensions.

* MavenFileFilter

  This component has a method which returns the default <<<FileUtils.FilterWrapper>>>.
  These are:

    * interpolation with token $\{ \} and values from properties files, project.build.filters, project.properties
      and mavenSession.executionProperties

    * interpolation with token @ @ and values from properties files, project.build.filters, project.properties
      and mavenSession.executionProperties

    * interpolation with token $\{ \} and values from mavenProject interpolation

    * interpolation with token @ @ and values from mavenProject interpolation

    []

    The values used for interpolation are stored in a <<<Properties>>> object
    and are loaded in the following order:

    * A <<<List>>> of properties files, provided as a parameter to the method

    * Filters defined in the <<<\<build\>>>>/<<<\<filters\>>>> section of the POM

    * Properties defined in the <<<\<properties\>>>> section of the POM

    * The <<<executionProperties>>> from the current <<<MavenSession>>>

    []

    <<Note>>: As it's a <<<Properties>>> object, the last defined key/value pair wins.

    <<Note>>: When building the <<<Properties>>> object and reading the properties files defining the different filters,
    interpolation with the token $\{ \} is supported for these filters with limited properties values coming from
    project.properties and mavenSession.executionProperties. The last wins here too.
