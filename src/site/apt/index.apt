Maven Dependency Tree

  A tree-based API for resolution of Maven project dependencies.

  Component entry point is <<<{{{./apidocs/org/apache/maven/shared/dependency/tree/DependencyTreeBuilder.html}DependencyTreeBuilder}}>>>.

  Notice that this component actually only works with Maven 2 but computes wrong information with Maven 3:
  see {{{http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MSHARED-167}MSHARED-167}}.
