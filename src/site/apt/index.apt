Maven Reporting Executor

  Classes to manage report plugin executions with Maven 3, through
  {{{./apidocs/org/apache/maven/reporting/exec/MavenReportExecutor.html}MavenReportExecutor}}
  ({{{./apidocs/org/apache/maven/reporting/exec/DefaultMavenReportExecutor.html}implementation}}):
  report plugins can be configured in <<<\<configuration\>>>> element of <<<maven-site-plugin>>> or any other
  report building plugin with following XML model:

+----+
<reportPlugins>
  <plugin>
    <groupId/>
    <artifactId/>
    <version/>
    <configuration/>
    <reports/>
    <reportSets>
      <reportSet>
        <id/>
        <configuration/>
        <reports/>
      </reportSet>
    </reportSets>
  </plugin>
</reportPlugins>
+----+

  Notice this is the model from plugins in
  {{{/ref/current/maven-model/maven.html#class_reporting}<<<\<reporting\>>>> section of POM}}:

  [[a]] without <<<\<inherited\>>>> element,
  
  [[b]] without support for reporting plugins configuration inheritance (see {{{http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MSITE-484}MSITE-484}}),

  [[c]] with additional <<<\<reports\>>>> list outside <<<\<reportSet\>>>> that simplifies reports configuration in usual cases,

  [[d]] with support for report plugins without explicit version: version is determed by

    [[1]] searching similar (same groupId and artifactId) mojo in the build/plugins section of the pom,
 
    [[2]] searching similar (same groupId and artifactId) mojo in the build/pluginManagement section of the pom,

    [[3]] asking {{{/ref/current/maven-core/apidocs/org/apache/maven/plugin/version/PluginVersionResolver.html}PluginVersionResolver}}
    to get a fallback version and display a warning as it's not a recommended use.

  Maven 3 core makes an automatic transformation of <<<\<reporting\>>>> POM section to <<<maven-site-plugin>>>
  configuration through the
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/ref/current/maven-model-builder/apidocs/org/apache/maven/model/plugin/ReportingConverter.html}ReportingConverter}}
  component.
