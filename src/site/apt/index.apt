Maven Dependency Tree

  A tree-based API for resolution of Maven project dependencies.

  Component entry point is <<<{{{./apidocs/org/apache/maven/shared/dependency/graph/DependencyGraphBuilder.html}DependencyGraphBuilder}}>>>,
  which will delegate to appropriate implementation for either Maven 2, Maven 3.0.x or Maven 3.1.x.

  Older Maven 2-specific component entry point is
  <<<{{{./apidocs/org/apache/maven/shared/dependency/tree/DependencyTreeBuilder.html}DependencyTreeBuilder}}>>>,
  which is consistent with Maven 2 even when used with Maven 3, which can cause inconsistent results between resolved list (consistent
  with Maven 3) and resolved tree (consistent with Maven 2): see {{{http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MSHARED-167}MSHARED-167}}.
